# Chemobrain: Analysis of the gut microbiome of chemotherapy patients with cognitive dysfunction
 Collaboration with Kilbourn lab - Results used for Emily Bilenduke's MS Thesis
 
 Assessed the contribution of the gut microbiome (as revealed by 16S sequencing) to cognitive dysfunction and depression in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.
 
 My role in this project was that of a analyst/consultant - I was not involved in data collection or study design.
 The JuPyter notebook includes QIIME2 command line analysis interfaced with the QIIME2 Python API and other Python libraries for statistical testing and visualizations.
